# Walmart Retail Sales Forecasting

A predictive analysis project that uses historical Walmart retail data to forecast weekly sales across different departments and stores using data science and machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- jupyter

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels jupyter
```

## Installing

- Clone the repository or download the files.
- Open the `.ipynb` file using **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**.
- Run the cells sequentially to explore the full analysis and modeling pipeline.

## Running the Tests

The notebook includes the following test stages:

### Breakdown of Tests

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualization and statistical summaries to understand sales trends, holidays impact, and correlation between features.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- **Model Training:**  
  Multiple regression models tested (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) to evaluate their accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Models were validated using RMSE and R² metrics to select the best-performing algorithm.

## Deployment

Currently, the project is intended for offline analysis.  
Future plans include deploying the model as a web service or integrating it into a business intelligence dashboard (e.g., **Power BI** or **Streamlit**).
